    "\n",
    "This coursework provides an exercise in computing posterior distributions, in the context of trying to maximise the \"payout\" of a \"multi-armed bandit\". (You may see this application again in one or more other units - it's related to problems in reinforcement learning.)\n",
    "\n",
    "A $K$-armed bandit (a little like a slot machine) has $K$ levers, and you may choose which one to pull. Associated with each lever is some payout distribution, the parameters of which are unknown to you at the outset. The name of the \"game\" is to try and maximise your earnings across a fixed number of $N$ pulls (here, we try $N=100$).\n",
    " \n",
    "A key question to consider at each pull is whether to \"exploit\" or \"explore\":\n",
    "- **exploit:** choose to pull the lever that has proved most profitable so far, or\n",
    "- **explore:** gather data from another lever and improve the state of knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "Managing the \"exploration-exploitation\" trade-off is a key aspect in search and reinforcement learning. This lab will utilise a Bayesian approach (which isn't necessary the best to adopt, but demonstrates the principles)."

    "`GammaBandit` is a $K$-armed bandit where the payout from each arm is a random sample from the Gamma distribution. This distribution has a fixed \"shape\" parameter $\\alpha=5$, but each arm has its own \"rate\" parameter $\\beta_k$.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "**Three points to note:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You should base your selector on Thompson sampling again. Sampling from the posteriors will give you values for $\\beta_k$, which then gives you an expected payout for each lever of $\\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta_k}$ (the mean of a Gamma distribution). Given the sample, choose the lever with highest mean to again maximise expected payout.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The Gamma distribution is usually defined in terms of $\\alpha$ (its \"shape\" parameter) and $\\beta$ (its \"rate\" parameter). The`scipy.stats` module parameterises the Gamma distribution in terms of `a` ($\\alpha$) and `scale`, the latter which is $1/\\beta$.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The `GammaBandit` is particularly mean! Quite possibly (with the default random seed), only the Bayesian Selector algorithm will be able to make a profit after 100 pulls.\n",
