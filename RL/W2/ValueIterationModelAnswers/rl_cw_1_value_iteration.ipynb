    "In this formative exercise, you will implement the Value Iteration algorithm to compute an optimal policy for three different (but closely related) Markov Decision Processes. For your reference, the pseudo-code for the Value Iteration algorithm is reproduced below from the textbook (Reinforcement Learning, Sutton & Barto, 2018, pp. 83).\n",

The symbol $r$ represents the immediate reward on transition from state $s$ to the next state $s'$ via action $a$. \n",
